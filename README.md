The Pok√©mon Trail
Team Members: Peter A, Angela C, Onah B.

Project Description

With your band of intrepid Poke-friends, set off across the Forest of Doom, through the Great Palm Jungle, and finally reach the legendary city of Pokegonemon.  Watch out for outbreaks of Ebola.

The player's animated character and small band of Pokemon walk through a one-dimensional, procedurally-generated environment, encountering obstacles along the way.  The game initially uses a flood of <img> elements to simulate the scenery, although work is continuing behind the scenes to transition this to HTML canvas for better preformance.
